CppDemos
========
Demo-Code for Common Things in C++

Such as 
 - configuration from file and command line
 - ...
 
 Well, I'm gonna extend it - for sure ;-)

Config Demo 
-----------

Tired of recompiling your project every time you change this one hardcoded value? You always wondered about command line arguments or config files? Well, wonder no longer! Because this demo provides a nice way of combining both using the boost/program_options library.


Smart Pointer Members Demo 
--------------------------

You have a class that holds a reference (a smart pointer - its 2021) to another class? The other class might be polymorphic? You are looking for an efficient way to set reference? Well, look no further!
